# Antipode Project

### What is it?
A simple pair of maps that takes one point and gives you it’s antipodal (diametrically opposite) coordinates, displaying where you’d be if you were at that point on the other side of the world.

*Latitude* specifies the north-south position of a point geographically. It measures the approximate angle between the local vertical and equatorial plane and ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° at the north or south poles.
Positive latitudes are north of the equator, and negative latitudes are to the south. You must convert your original latitude to the opposite hemisphere. 45°N will be 45° South, or -45°.

*Longitude*, therefore, specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earths surface or celestial body and is the astronomical vertical. Positive longitudes are east of the Prime Meridian, and negative longitudes are west.
To find the antipode of your longitudinal point, you must subtract 180°, the result is your converted point on the opposite hemisphere.
25° W will be 180° - 25° = 155° E, or -155°.
